# darkosre-ogage-fn

## Introduction
This script will set your global hotkey to FN for dARKOSRE, just like AeolusUX/ArkOS-R3XS.

## Instructions
1. download as zip and extract.
2. Copy Ogage folder, install_ogage_fn.sh and restore_ogage_r3.sh into your ROMS partition's tools folder of the SD card.
3. On your R36S, under Options > Tools, you should see the files you copied.
4. Run install_ogage_fn.sh

## Other details
- restore_ogage_r3.sh will restore the original R3 global hotkey from the ROMS partition's tool folder. You can also try to reboot your device to ensure the restoration.
- This Ogage-fn binary was compiled against https://github.com/christianhaitian/ogage/tree/rg351mp. This means it only has the vanilla controls.
- If you require additional controls like controlling gamma or need the original dARKOSRE controls, you can compile against https://github.com/southoz/dArkOSRE-R36/tree/main/resources/github/ogage
- The script is still usable as long as you replace the binary inside the Ogage folder with your compiled ogage. Tweak the script as you require.
